# CSS Positioning

## What I learnt

## Key Words

```positioning``` | ```static (default)``` | ```absolute``` | ```relative``` | ```fixed``` | ```sticky``` | ```z-index```

## Position

Allows you to control the placement of html elements. Once position has been set the element can be moved around using the top, right, left or bottom properties.

top, right, left or bottom **_won't work_** with `position: static`

| **_Property_** |                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| relative       | Positions element relative to it's normal flow position                                          |
| absolute       | Takes element out of the normal flow and positions relative to the top left corner of its parent |
| fixed          | Element remains in a fixed position when scrolling                                               |
| sticky         | Element will remain fixed until a specified scroll position                                      |

## transform

Manipulate elements using the following functions:

`translate()` | `rotate()` | `scale()` | `skew()` | `matrix()`

## Reflection

Positioning is a relatively simple concept, just needs practice to understand how it can impact the flow of an html document.

Transform again is a simple idea but needs practice to bed in knowledge and uderstanding.
